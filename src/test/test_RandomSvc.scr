# The script is used to test whether Gleam can reproduce an event if the same
# seed is used as input. It works as the followings:
# First, Gleam.exe is run with begin_seed.dat as inputs. begin_seed.dat 
# contains seeds for 10 events. The first 5 events have the same set of the
# seeds as the second 5 events, but they are in different order.
# Gleam.exe produces a asci file end_seed.dat which contains seeds at the
# end of each event.
# CheckSeed.exe is then run whether the end seeds are consistent.
# It return 0 if consistent, otherwise it returns 1.
